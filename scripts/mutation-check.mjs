/**
 * Mutation check: reintroduce known bugs and prove the suite goes red.
 *
 * Every defect this plugin has shipped failed SILENTLY — no throw, no error
 * log, a bot that looked connected and did nothing. Line coverage does not
 * catch that class of bug: a line runs during a test whether or not anything
 * asserts on what it did. `src/decisions.ts` sat at 100% statement coverage
 * while three of its behaviours had no assertion behind them, including two a
 * commit message claimed to have covered.
 *
 * So this is the check that coverage cannot make: break the code on purpose,
 * and fail if the tests still pass.
 *
 *   npm run test:mutations
 *   npm run test:mutations -- --filter=verbs   # one mutation, by id substring
 *   npm run test:mutations -- --list           # show the catalogue, run nothing
 *
 * Adding a mutation is the cheapest way to lock in a bug you just fixed:
 * describe the user-visible failure in `breaks`, and point `find`/`replace` at
 * the guard that prevents it.
 *
 * A mutation whose `find` anchor no longer matches is a HARD FAILURE, not a
 * skip. A silently-skipped mutation is the same false confidence this script
 * exists to remove — if you refactor the source, re-anchor the mutation.
